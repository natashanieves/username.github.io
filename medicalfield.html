<td>Abstract</td>
<td>In this article Pallavicini and Pepe set out to test whether virtual reality games enhanced positive emotion and decrease negative emotions and reduce anxiety. They also investigated the effects of the body movement involved with the Vr technology. During the study, 36 young adults played 2 different types of games. The first was the low body-movement game Fruit Ninja VR and the high body-movement game Autoshield.  To gather their results they used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form-Y1, and The Visual Analogue Scale. The study concluded that virtual reality video games can be useful tools to promote positive emotions and decrease anxiety. It also concluded that high body-movement games increase positive emotions more than low body-movement games. </td>

<td>Abstract</td>
<td>This article discusses some of the ways virtual reality is being introduced into the medical field. Currently, it has started becoming used for psychiatric therapy, rehabilitation, and pain management. Laith K Hasan et al. discuss some of the ways Virtuality reality has been implemented in the field of orthopaedic surgical training.  The use of virtual reality technology in surgical training has allowed residents to practice their training exercises, without making physical contact with a patient. It is a fully immersive experience and leaves residents feeling as though they performed a real surgical procedure. According to Hassan, many studies have been done over the years and have shown significant improvement in resident surgical skill.</td>
