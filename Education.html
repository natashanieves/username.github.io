<td>Abstract</td>
<td>This article explains a study conducted by Sarioglu and Girgin to test whether the use of Virtual reality in the classroom would improve academic success and boost attitudes in class. As the technology in the world is advancing everyday, students could use different types of technologies to overcome certain difficulties they may be facing. Many younger students have a short attention span and struggle to sit through class and pay attention. Sarioglu and Girgin believe that Considering  the promises and potential of virtual reality technology, it can be considered as an application that can bring a new breath to science education. To conduct their research, they 100 6th grade students and performed a series of experiments and then answered an achievement test that was examined. The study revealed that students using the virtual reality technology had a positive effect on their academic achievement.
